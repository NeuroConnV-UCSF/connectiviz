# connectiviz

We aim to develop an open-source interactive visualization package that can be used to explore network-based functional MRI connectivity. Specifically, to help develop a functional connectivity profile that aids the investigation of inter and intra-network connectivity and understand the broader impact of atrophy on network-level architecture.
